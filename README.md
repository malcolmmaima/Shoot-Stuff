# Shoot-Stuff Android/PC Game (Prototype)
 
http://shootstuff.malcolmmaima.com 

Shootstuff is a nice simple strategy game available on the Android/PC platforms. You simply shoot stuff that is
shooting at you and make sure you don't die. Main goal is to survive in the 2D world for as long as possible and 
gain the highest score possible, screenshot scores and share with friends. I made it with C# using Unity Game Engine.
It has been tested on Android version 4.0+ and is only a DEMO version. Tools and Technology used were: Visual Studio 2013,
Unity 4.6, and Adobe Photoshop CS6. 

This Project took a month of full time coding and debugging, all from ground zero. It was a huge learning experience 
and I had a lot of fun working on it, watching it work on my friendsâ€™ devices and getting constant feedback concerning
the game-play.
